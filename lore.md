# Summary:
Lacryae is a small, peaceful land, but danger looms on the horizon. Adamo, one small town and former home to the gods Amadeus and Callum, is in danger of being plunged into the darkness of war. Amadeus, the all-knowing, and Callum, the all-powerful, are at odds against each other, with their devoted followers caught in the webs of war.

For now, Amadeus is locked away in the realm of the Night Beasts, but the thin shroud between the worlds is getting thinner and thinner. Callum, however, is nowhere to be found, with the voices of his followers falling on deaf ears.

# Gods:
Amadeus: Amadeus is a small, quiet man, but his temper is like a raging fire. He used to be shy, before being locked away. The time spent being locked away, approximately 1000 years, sharpened his tongue and smoothed his voice.

Callum: Callum is a strong, commanding man, with an aura that causes everyone around him to get excited. He spends his time searching for a cure for being immortal, and despises his former friend for turning him.
